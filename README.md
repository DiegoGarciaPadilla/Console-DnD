# Dungeons and Dragons üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## What is this?

Ready for a new adventure? This is a Dungeons and Dragons game that you can play in the command line. It's a work in progress, but it's playable. Unfortunately, it's not very fun yet. I'm working on it.

## How do I play?

Because the game is developed in C++, you'll need to compile it. For that, you'll need a C++ compiler. For Windows, I recommend [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). For Mac, I recommend [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). For Linux, I recommend [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

Once you have a compiler, you can compile the game by running `g++ -o game main.cpp` in the root directory of the project. Then, you can run the game by running `./game`.
